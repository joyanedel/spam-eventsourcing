# Spam eventsourcing

Welcome to Spam eventsourcing

## What is it?

Spam eventsourcing is a prove of concept of eventsourcing applied to a system
that tries to sell some product to companies through its employees.

The main idea is keeping track of every transaction made during the communication process
between the system and the employees so we don't depend on updates on database.
If we are able to trace these transactions with all the details, then if requirements
change through the time, it won't be necessary to remodel the database itself but the aggregation schema
(if required)

## Is it profitable?

The short answer is no, this project is not profitable at all, you CANNOT copy the code or any idea contained
due to restriction of this idea project itself. I'm not the intelectual actorm i'm just trying to apply new patterns
on a private idea.
