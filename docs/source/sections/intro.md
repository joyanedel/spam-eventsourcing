# Introduction

This project is for learning event sourcing the right way and improve at testing and documentation.
The base of the project is implementing a spam system that will try to 'sell' any product to companies.
In order to make contact with these companies, we firstly have to contact some of their employees
and that where the heart of this project belongs.
