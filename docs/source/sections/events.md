# Events

The system can be in presence of two kind of events, the first ones are the generated by the system ifself.
What are these generated events?

* Send an email
* Reply to an email

The second kind of events are the ones from outside:

* Employee reply to one of our emails without closing any deal
* Employee rejects the contact try
* Employee accept a deal
* Employee refer us to another employee
...

The system will model an employee aggregate based on all external events and therefore will model
a company based on its employee aggregates.

```{admonition} About eventsourcing on company aggregate
:class: warning
Due to eventsourcing pattern, in order to model a company aggregate we must validate some employee events in runtime to generate company events.
```
